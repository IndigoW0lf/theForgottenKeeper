Your mission:  
- Unlock these mystical books.  
- Restore broken worlds through exploration, spellcasting, and problem-solving.  
- Uncover the secrets behind the library’s decline and bring it back to life.

As you progress, the library evolves visually, reflecting the restoration of its magic and purpose.
